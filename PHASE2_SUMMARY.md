## ✅ All Requirements Met

### From Problem Statement

1. ✅ **Enhance Incident Data Structure**
   - Three-stage structure (detect/respond/resolve)
   - Stage tracking with status, timing, SLA limits
   - Specialist assignment per stage
   - Overall success tracking

2. ✅ **Implement Stage Progression Logic**
   - `updateIncidentStage()` - Stage updates
   - `calculateStageProgress()` - Progress calculation
   - `advanceToNextStage()` - Stage transitions
   - `getRequiredStatForStage()` - Stat mapping

3. ✅ **Update Incident Creation**
   - Initialize three-stage structure
   - Get SLA limits from contracts
   - Set detect stage to IN_PROGRESS
   - Always set contractId

4. ✅ **Update Threat Data**
   - Added stageRequirements to 6 threats
   - Stage-specific difficulty multipliers
   - Recommended stat levels

5. ✅ **Specialist Auto-Assignment**
   - `autoAssignSpecialistsToStage()` implemented
   - Stat-based selection
   - Severity-based count
   - Availability checking

6. ✅ **Update Main Update Loop**
   - Calls `updateIncidentStage()` for all incidents
   - Legacy support maintained
   - Specialist cooldown updates

7. ✅ **Connect to SLA System**
   - Event subscriptions ready
   - `incident_stage_completed` event
   - `incident_fully_resolved` event
   - ContractId always passed

8. ✅ **Add Helper Functions**
   - `getIncident()`
   - `removeIncident()`
   - `getIncidentsByContract()`
   - `getSpecialist()`
   - `getAvailableSpecialists()`

9. ✅ **State Management**
   - `getState()` saves new structure
   - `loadState()` restores incidents
   - `migrateIncidentToStageFormat()` for old saves

10. ✅ **Testing and Validation**
    - 8 comprehensive unit tests
    - All test patterns followed
    - Mock objects used properly

11. ✅ **Documentation**
    - Full implementation guide
    - Quick reference guide
    - Code examples included

## 🎯 Core Features

### Three-Stage Lifecycle

```
DETECT (trace stat, 45s)
   ↓
RESPOND (speed stat, 180s)
   ↓
RESOLVE (efficiency stat, 600s)
   ↓
COMPLETE
```

### Progress Formula

```lua
progress = (totalStat × duration) / (severity × baseDifficulty)
```

### Specialist Assignment

- **Low Severity (1-3)**: 1 specialist
- **Medium Severity (4-6)**: 2 specialists  
- **High Severity (7-10)**: 3 specialists

### SLA Compliance

- **All stages pass**: 100% rewards + mission tokens
- **Any stage fails**: 60% money, 50% reputation, 70% XP

---

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Contract System
- `getContract(contractId)` - New method added
- `getSLALimitForStage()` - Uses contract SLA requirements
- Falls back to defaults if contract not found

### Event Bus
- `incident_stage_completed` - Published per stage
- `incident_fully_resolved` - Published on completion
- Full event data for SLA tracking

### Resource Manager
- Awards scaled based on SLA compliance
- Specialist XP distribution
- Mission token rewards

### Game State Engine
- Save/load with new structure
- Automatic migration of old format
- State preservation

---
