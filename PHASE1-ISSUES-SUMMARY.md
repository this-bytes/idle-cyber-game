## Next Steps
1. Create milestone and labels in GitHub repository
2. Create each issue using the content from corresponding `issue-bodies/` file
3. Assign issues to developers following dependency order
4. Begin development starting with foundation systems (Issues #1, #2)
5. Conduct regular progress reviews against acceptance criteria

## Success Criteria
By the end of Phase 1, the game should have:
- ✅ Playable basic game with clicking mechanics
- ✅ Simple upgrade system with first-tier purchases
- ✅ Automated resource generation (server farms)
- ✅ Processing power multiplier system
- ✅ Basic threat and defense mechanics
- ✅ Functional save/load system
- ✅ Stable 60 FPS performance
- ✅ Foundation ready for Phase 2 expansion

All issues are ready for immediate creation and development can begin as soon as they are assigned to developers.
