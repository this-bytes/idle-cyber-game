## Strategic Considerations

### Choice Event Example: Security Patch
**Situation**: "A new, experimental security patch is available. Install it?"

**Option 1: Install the patch**
- 70% chance: +500 money, +1 reputation (successful implementation)
- 30% chance: -200 money, -1 reputation (system instability)

**Option 2: Wait for stable release**  
- No immediate effect (safe but no potential benefit)

### Tips
- Choice events often involve risk vs. reward decisions
- Consider your current resource levels before taking risks
- Positive events help build reserves for handling negative events
- Some events may become more frequent or severe as you progress

## Technical Details
- Events trigger automatically every 25 seconds during gameplay
- Choice events pause the auto-trigger until resolved
- All events are defined in `src/data/events.json` for easy modding
- Resource changes are processed through the ResourceManager
- Event probability outcomes use proper random distribution

## Troubleshooting
- **Events not appearing**: Check that the EventSystem is loaded in the game
- **Choices not working**: Ensure you're pressing number keys (1, 2, 3)
- **No resource changes**: Verify ResourceManager is properly integrated
- **Events too frequent/rare**: Adjust `eventInterval` in EventSystem (default: 25 seconds)

The Dynamic Event System adds strategic depth and narrative richness to your idle cybersecurity management experience!
