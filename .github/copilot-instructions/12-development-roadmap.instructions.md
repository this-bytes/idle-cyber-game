### Phase 2 - Expansion (Weeks 3-4)
**Core Objectives:**
- Expand upgrade variety and complexity
- Introduce multiple contract tiers and client types
- Implement multi-stage threat escalation

**Deliverables:**
- Advanced upgrade trees
- Multiple contract tiers and client variety
- Threat escalation and multi-stage crises

### Phase 3 - Depth (Weeks 5-8)
**Core Objectives:**
- Implement deeper progression, prestige, and balancing
- Create dynamic events and encounters
- Polish visuals and audio

**Deliverables:**
- Progression and prestige systems
- Events and random encounters
- Visual polish and audio layering

### Phase 4 - Community (Weeks 9-12)
**Core Objectives:**
- Prepare community features and leaderboards
- Finalize release readiness and packaging

**Deliverables:**
- Leaderboards, achievements
- Packaging and cross-platform testing

## Git Workflow Strategy

### Branch Structure
**Main Branches:**
- **`main` branch:** Latest stable, playable version
- **`develop` branch:** Integration branch for completed features

**Feature Branches:**
Each major system gets its own dedicated branch following the naming convention:
`feature/[system-name]`

### Commit Guidelines

**Commit Message Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature implementation
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without feature changes
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Development Workflow

**Starting New Feature:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
```

**Regular Development:**
```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): descriptive commit message"
git push origin feature/new-feature-name
```

**Completing Feature:**
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge feature/new-feature-name
git push origin develop
# Create pull request to main branch
```

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Core calculation functions and game logic
- **Integration Tests:** Save/load functionality and system interactions
- **Performance Tests:** Idle mechanics and resource calculations
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Gameplay balance and player experience

### Automated Testing Pipeline
Add project-specific scripts when CI is configured. For local testing, ensure linting and basic smoke tests are run before PRs.

### Manual Testing Checklist
- Resource generation calculations are accurate
- Save/load preserves all game state
- UI is responsive and intuitive
- Threat system works as designed
- Upgrades provide expected benefits

## Release Management

### Version Numbering
Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

### Release Schedule
Flexible cadence; aim for small, frequent releases during early development.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Provide CI pipeline examples when repo CI is configured. Typical steps: install deps, run unit tests, run lint, run build/smoke.

## Project Management and Tracking

Use issues, PR templates, and milestone tracking to manage scope. Prioritize small, testable features.

## Documentation

### Player Documentation
- **Game Manual:** Comprehensive guide to all game mechanics
- **Tutorial System:** In-game tutorials for new players
- **FAQ:** Common questions and answers
- **Strategy Guides:** Community-contributed optimization guides

### Developer Documentation
- **Setup Guide:** How to set up development environment
- **Contributing Guide:** How to contribute to the project
- **Architecture Overview:** High-level system design documentation
- **Release Notes:** Detailed changelog for each release

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Performance Issues:** Regular profiling and optimization
- **Save File Corruption:** Robust validation and backup systems
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Regular testing on all platforms
- **Dependency Issues:** Pin versions and maintain local copies

### Project Risks
- **Scope Creep:** Regular review of features against original vision
- **Timeline Delays:** Buffer time in milestones for unexpected issues
- **Resource Constraints:** Prioritize features by impact and effort
- **Team Coordination:** Clear communication channels and documentation

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Regular Backups:** Automated backups of code and assets
- **Code Reviews:** All changes reviewed before merging to main
- **Testing Coverage:** Comprehensive automated testing suite
- **Rollback Plans:** Ability to quickly revert problematic changes
