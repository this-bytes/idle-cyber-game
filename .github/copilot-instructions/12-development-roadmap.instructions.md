## Git Workflow Strategy

### Branch Structure
**Main Branches:**
- **`main` branch:** Latest stable, playable version
- **`develop` branch:** Integration branch for completed features
- **`release/v1.x` branches:** Preparation for specific releases

**Feature Branches:**
Each major system gets its own dedicated branch following the naming convention:
`feature/[system-name]`

Examples:
- `feature/manual-data-harvest`
- `feature/basic-server-farm`
- `feature/processing-cores`
- `feature/basic-firewall`
- `feature/threat-system-v1`
- `feature/zone-system`
- `feature/faction-system`
- `feature/achievement-system`
- `feature/prestige-system`

### Commit Guidelines

**Commit Message Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature implementation
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without feature changes
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples of Good Commit Messages:**
- `feat(resources): implement basic data generation per second`
- `feat(ui): add button for Manual Data Harvest`
- `fix(threats): correct damage calculation for DDoS attacks`
- `refactor(upgrades): extract cost calculation to separate function`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

**Commit Principles:**
- **Descriptive and atomic commits:** Each commit represents one logical change
- **Regular merging:** Complete features merged back to main frequently
- **No direct commits to main:** All development happens on feature branches

### Development Workflow

**Starting New Feature:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
```

**Regular Development:**
```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): descriptive commit message"
git push origin feature/new-feature-name
```

**Completing Feature:**
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge feature/new-feature-name
git push origin develop
# Create pull request to main branch
```

**Release Process:**
```bash
git checkout -b release/v1.0.0 develop
# Final testing and bug fixes
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.0.0
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin main --tags
```

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Core calculation functions and game logic
- **Integration Tests:** Save/load functionality and system interactions
- **Performance Tests:** Idle mechanics and resource calculations
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Gameplay balance and player experience

### Automated Testing Pipeline
```bash
# Run before each commit
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run lint
npm run build
```

### Quality Metrics
- **Code Coverage:** Minimum 80% coverage for critical systems
- **Performance Benchmarks:** Maintain 60 FPS with 1000+ upgrades
- **Memory Usage:** Stay under 100MB on mobile devices
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** All features work on all supported platforms

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Resource generation calculations are accurate
- [ ] Save/load preserves all game state
- [ ] UI is responsive and intuitive
- [ ] Threat system works as designed
- [ ] Upgrades provide expected benefits
- [ ] Performance is acceptable on target hardware

## Release Management

### Version Numbering
**Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):**
- **MAJOR:** Incompatible API changes or major feature overhauls
- **MINOR:** New features that are backward-compatible
- **PATCH:** Bug fixes and small improvements

**Examples:**
- `v0.1.0` - Initial MVP release
- `v0.2.0` - Added zone system
- `v0.2.1` - Fixed save/load bug
- `v1.0.0` - First complete release

### Release Schedule
- **Weekly:** Patch releases for critical bug fixes
- **Bi-weekly:** Minor releases with new features
- **Monthly:** Major feature releases
- **Quarterly:** Major version releases with significant changes

### Release Process
1. **Feature Freeze:** Stop adding new features to release branch
2. **Testing Phase:** Comprehensive testing and bug fixing
3. **Release Candidate:** Create RC build for final testing
4. **Release:** Tag and deploy to all platforms
5. **Post-Release:** Monitor for issues and prepare hotfixes

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

### Automated Build Pipeline
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Build and Test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Lua
        uses: leafo/gh-actions-lua@v8
      - name: Run Tests
        run: lua test/run_tests.lua
      - name: Build Game
        run: love . --console
```

### Deployment Strategy
- **Development:** Automatic deployment to dev server on push to develop
