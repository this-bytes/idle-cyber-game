- *Predictive Threat Intelligence* (125,000 DB): Forecasts attack patterns
- *Quantum Entangled Monitors* (625,000 DB): Instantaneous threat detection across all systems

### Active Defense Systems

**Counter-Attack Capabilities:**
- *Honeypot Networks* (2,000 DB): Trap attackers and gather intelligence
- *Digital Vigilante Bots* (10,000 DB): Hunt down and neutralize threat sources
- *Hack-Back Operations* (50,000 DB): Infiltrate and disable attacker systems
- *AI Revenge Protocols* (250,000 DB): Autonomous retaliation systems

**Personnel & Human Resources:**
- *Junior Security Analyst* (5,000 DB): +5 Security Rating, basic threat response
- *Senior Cybersecurity Engineer* (25,000 DB): +15 Security Rating, advanced threat analysis
- *Elite White-Hat Hacker* (125,000 DB): +30 Security Rating, offensive capabilities
- *Former Government Cyber-Warrior* (625,000 DB): +50 Security Rating, classified techniques
- *Reformed Black-Hat Legend* (3,125,000 DB): +100 Security Rating, ultimate expertise

## Player Interaction & Strategy

### Manual Defense Actions
- *Emergency Response Protocol* (Cost: 100 PP): Temporarily double Security Rating for 60 seconds
- *System Lockdown* (Cost: 500 DB): Become immune to attacks for 30 seconds, but halt all generation
- *Counter-Intelligence Operation* (Cost: 1,000 DB): Trace attackers and reduce future threat frequency
- *Diplomatic Immunity* (Cost: 10,000 DB): Negotiate temporary cease-fire with specific faction

### Defense Automation Levels
1. *Manual:* Player must click to activate defenses
2. *Semi-Automatic:* Defenses auto-activate but player chooses response type
3. *Automatic:* Defenses handle routine threats automatically
4. *Autonomous:* AI makes all defense decisions independently
5. *Precognitive:* System prevents attacks before they're even planned

### Risk vs. Reward Systems
- Higher Security Rating reduces resource generation efficiency
- Operating in high-risk zones provides better rewards
- Some upgrades increase threat level but offer massive benefits
- Players can choose aggressive expansion or defensive consolidation strategies

## Threat Scaling & Balancing

### Dynamic Threat Level
- Base Threat Level = Player Net Worth ^ 0.75
- Zone modifiers apply additional multipliers
- Faction relations affect threat types and frequency
- Recent player actions influence threat targeting

### Defense Effectiveness
- Attack Success Chance = max(0, Threat Level - Security Rating × Defense Multipliers)
- Critical defense failures have cascading effects
- Overconfidence penalties for extremely high security ratings

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Basic Threat System
1. Implement Tier 1 threats (Script Kiddie, Basic Malware)
2. Basic Firewall upgrade (Packet Filter)
3. Simple Security Rating calculation
4. Manual defense activation system

### Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Expanded Defense
1. Add more Tier 1 threats (Phishing, DDoS)
2. Implement Anti-Malware systems
3. Add threat frequency scaling based on player progress
4. Introduce semi-automatic defense options

### Phase 3 (Weeks 5-8): Advanced Systems
1. Tier 2 threats with complex mechanics
2. Personnel hiring system
3. Counter-attack capabilities
4. Faction-based threat variations

### Phase 4 (Weeks 9-12): Complete System
1. Tier 3 threats and special events
2. Full automation levels
3. Advanced AI-driven threats
4. Global event coordination

## Mathematical Framework

### Threat Timing Calculations
```
Next Attack Time = Base Interval × (1 + Random(-0.3, +0.5)) × Zone Modifier × Faction Relations
```

### Defense Success Rate
```
Success Rate = min(95%, Security Rating / (Threat Level × Attack Sophistication))
```

### Damage Calculations
```
Damage = Base Threat Damage × (1 - Defense Effectiveness) × Critical Hit Multiplier
```

### Resource Loss Prevention
```
Protected Resources = Total Resources × min(0.9, Security Rating / Max Security Rating)
```

## User Experience Considerations

### Visual Feedback
- Screen shake effects during major attacks
- Color changes to indicate threat levels
- Alert notifications with escalating urgency
- Progress bars for ongoing attacks

### Audio Cues
- Escalating tension music during attacks
- Different alert sounds for different threat types
- Victory fanfares for successful defense
- Ambient tension during high-threat periods

### Accessibility
- Colorblind-friendly threat indicators
- Audio descriptions for visual alerts
- Customizable notification intensity
- Pause-and-plan options for strategic players
