# Progression & Prestige — Cyber Empire Command

Overview
Defines how the player's firm grows, how specialists progress, and the long-term prestige/legacy mechanics.

Specialist Progression
- XP from contracts and crisis events.
- Levels grant stat increases and unlock new abilities.
- Hard caps per tier for early phases (e.g., 10 levels per tier), expand later.

Company Progression
- Company Tier: startup → boutique → enterprise → global consultancy. Each tier unlocks new contracts and facilities.
- Metrics: Net Worth, Reputation Score, Market Penetration.

Prestige / Legacy
- After reaching defined global milestones (e.g., complete a Global Contract milestone), the firm can "Incorporate Legacy" (soft prestige).
- Prestige grants permanent bonuses (e.g., small % to passive income or specialist XP gain) and unlocks unique cosmetic assets or elite roles.
- Preserve balance: prestige should feel meaningful but not mandatory for casual players.

Unlockables & Tech Tree
- Facilities, automation levels, and subscription services unlock with progression.
- Cosmetic unlocks for HQ and specialists (neon skins, portraits) are tied to milestones and achievements.

Design notes
- Make long-term progression rewarding and visible (metrics, leaderboards for dev/test).
- Allow players to "specialize" their firm (e.g., APT defense, ransomware recovery, research salvage) for replayability.
