## Mathematical Frameworks

### XP Generation Formula
```
XP = Base Action Value × Efficiency Multiplier × Zone Bonus × Skill Tree Bonus
```

### Prestige Requirements
```
Prestige Cost = Base Requirement × (Prestige Level ^ 2.5) × Layer Multiplier
```

### Quantum Echo Generation
```
Quantum Echoes = sqrt(Total Progress) × Prestige Layer Bonus × Achievement Multiplier
```

### Skill Tree Costs
```
Skill Cost = Base Skill Cost × (1.3 ^ Skill Level) × Tree Complexity
```

## Balancing Considerations

### Time Gates & Milestones
- Early game: Progress measured in minutes to hours
- Mid game: Progress measured in hours to days
- Late game: Progress measured in days to weeks
- Endgame: Progress measured in weeks to months

### Prestige Balancing
- First prestige available at ~1 week of active play
- Each prestige layer requires 2-3x longer than previous
- Quantum echo bonuses provide meaningful but not overwhelming advantages
- Prestige benefits scale with number of prestiges completed

### Difficulty Scaling
- Each zone significantly more challenging than previous
- Prestige layers increase complexity, not just numbers
- Skill trees enable specialized builds and strategies
- Achievement system rewards diverse play styles
