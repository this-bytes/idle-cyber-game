# Endgame & Meta Systems â€” Idle Sec Ops

High-Level Vision
- Endgame revolves around reputation, global contracts, and rare "Singularity-level" events that test the player's whole firm.
- Long-term goals: create a resilient, diversified Managed SOC that can handle the toughest multi-stage crises.

Endgame Features
- Global Contracts: simultaneous multi-client crisis coordination for massive rewards.
- Seasonal/Timed Global Events: community-driven megathreats or cooperative defense projects.
- Leaderboards & Achievements: track firm value, successful crisis defenses, and time-to-resolution metrics.

Longevity & Replayability
- Multiple firm archetypes (e.g., Forensics-first, Offensive Consultancy) with unique progression trees.
- Prestige layers that allow new runs with legacy bonuses and cosmetic content.
- Procedural client generation for endless variety (names, budgets, tech stacks).

Community & Social Play (optional roadmap)
- Co-op emergency responses (multiple players coordinate on a global threat).
- Market maps and trade of non-critical assets (cosmetics, templates).
- Shared research pool for community-driven tech unlocks.

Design constraints
- Keep primary experience single-player; social features are optional.
- Preserve fairness if competitive elements are introduced (no pay-to-win).
