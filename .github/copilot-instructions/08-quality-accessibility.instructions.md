# Quality of Life & Accessibility â€” Idle Sec Ops

Core Goals
- Make the game approachable for a wide audience while preserving depth for experienced players.
- Ensure crisis interactions are accessible (clear visuals, keyboard or touch controls, adjustable timing options).

Accessibility Features
- High-contrast mode and colorblind palettes built from the neon palette.
- Adjustable font sizes and UI scaling.
- Reduced motion option to limit scanlines/CRT flicker.
- Keyboard-first controls and full mouse/touch support.

Quality of Life
- Auto-assign & priority rules for idle staffing.
- Offline progress calculation with safe caps and a clear "away summary" screen.
- Bulk purchase toggles for upgrades.
- Save slots and cloud sync hooks (when implemented).

Tutorial & Onboarding
- Progressive, interactive tutorial covering idle basics and the first Crisis Mode.
- Contextual hints and optional "training wheels" for Crisis Mode.
- Clear indicators of action cost and cooldowns.

Testing & Metrics
- Include metrics hooks to measure accessibility usage and to catch problematic patterns (e.g., too-fast crises).
- Playtest with accessibility focus groups early.
