# Defense Mechanics & Threat Systems

## Dual-Mode Threat Framework

### Idle Mode Threats (Wave-Based)
*[Previous content remains as documented above]*

### "The Admin's Watch" Mode Threats (Persistent & Adaptive)

**Core Threat Philosophy:**
- Threats are **continuous**, not wave-based
- Attackers **adapt** to your defensive strategies over time
- **Multiple simultaneous** threats create resource allocation challenges
- **Real-time decision making** under pressure is essential

#### Persistent Low-Level Threats (Always Active)

**Port Scanning Attempts:**
- **Frequency:** Constant background activity (every 10-30 seconds)
- **Impact:** Minimal direct damage, but provides intel to attackers
- **Defense:** Basic firewall rules, port obfuscation
- **Adaptation:** Scanning patterns change based on discovered open ports

**Automated Bot Probes:**
- **Frequency:** 3-5 attempts per minute across different attack vectors
- **Impact:** Consumes bandwidth, may find vulnerabilities
- **Defense:** Rate limiting, bot detection algorithms
- **Adaptation:** Bots rotate IP addresses and attack patterns

**Social Engineering Attempts:**
- **Frequency:** 1-2 per hour targeting different employees
- **Impact:** May compromise credentials or gain insider information
- **Defense:** Security training, email filtering, behavioral monitoring
- **Adaptation:** Attackers learn which employees are most susceptible

#### Dynamic Medium Threats (Escalating Attacks)

**Coordinated Brute Force Campaigns:**
- **Trigger:** Multiple failed login attempts detected
- **Escalation:** Increases intensity based on defensive response
- **Impact:** Account lockouts, authentication system overload
- **Defense Options:**
  - *Immediate Lockdown:* Stop all attacks but halt legitimate access
  - *Selective Filtering:* Resource-intensive but maintains operations
  - *Counter-Intelligence:* Expensive but provides attacker information

**Advanced Malware Deployment:**
- **Trigger:** Successful initial compromise (from low-level threats)
- **Behavior:** Spreads laterally, adapts to defensive countermeasures
- **Impact:** Gradual system degradation, data corruption, backdoor installation
- **Defense Options:**
  - *Network Segmentation:* Limits spread but reduces operational efficiency
  - *Full System Scan:* Comprehensive but resource-intensive
  - *Surgical Removal:* Precise but requires expert personnel time

**Supply Chain Infiltration:**
- **Trigger:** Third-party vendor compromises (random events)
- **Complexity:** May remain dormant until activated by external triggers
- **Impact:** Deep system access, trusted process compromise
- **Defense Options:**
  - *Vendor Isolation:* Secure but limits business operations
  - *Enhanced Monitoring:* Resource-heavy continuous surveillance
  - *Trust Verification:* Expensive cryptographic validation

#### High-Impact Crisis Events (Requiring Immediate Response)

**Coordinated Nation-State Attack:**
- **Warning:** 60-180 seconds advance notice from threat intelligence
- **Duration:** 10-30 minutes of intensive assault
- **Multiple Vectors:** Simultaneous DDoS, malware, social engineering, physical threats
- **Resource Demand:** Requires all available CPU, bandwidth, and personnel
- **Decision Pressure:** Must choose which systems to prioritize for protection

**Zero-Day Exploit Chain:**
- **Warning:** None (unless premium threat intelligence provides prediction)
- **Impact:** Bypasses all conventional defenses
- **Spread:** Exponential infection rate across vulnerable systems
- **Response Options:**
  - *Emergency Patch:* Use consumable to fix immediately
  - *System Isolation:* Quarantine affected systems, halt operations
  - *Deep Analysis:* Invest heavily in understanding the exploit

**Insider Threat Activation:**
- **Trigger:** Disgruntled employee or compromised insider
- **Advantage:** Bypasses perimeter defenses, knows system weaknesses
- **Detection:** Behavioral analysis systems may provide early warning
- **Response Complexity:** Must balance investigation with operational security

### Adaptive Threat Intelligence

**Learning Algorithms:**
- Attackers observe your defensive responses and adapt strategies
- Repeated use of same defensive tactics reduces effectiveness over time
- Successful novel defenses provide temporary advantages
- Long-term success requires varied, unpredictable defensive strategies

**Threat Attribution System:**
- Track attack sources: Script kiddies, criminal organizations, nation-states, competitors
- Each group has preferred tactics and different resource levels
- Diplomatic relationships affect attack frequency and intensity
- Counter-intelligence can provide advance warning of planned attacks

**Economic Warfare Integration:**
- Attacks may target company stock price rather than direct damage
- Market manipulation through selective information leaks
- Timing attacks to coincide with earnings reports or major announcements
- Recovery strategies must consider both technical and economic impacts

### Network Visualization & Management Interface

**Real-Time Network Map:**
- **Server Status:** Green (secure), Yellow (under attack), Red (compromised)
- **Traffic Flow:** Visualize data movement and identify abnormal patterns
- **Threat Indicators:** Glowing red lines showing malicious traffic paths
- **Resource Allocation:** Drag-and-drop interface for deploying defenses

**Dynamic Topology:**
- Network layout changes based on business requirements
- New servers come online during business expansion
- Legacy systems create security weak points
- Load balancing affects traffic patterns and attack surfaces

**Crisis Management Dashboard:**
- **Threat Level Indicator:** Overall system security status
- **Resource Availability:** Real-time CPU, bandwidth, personnel allocation
- **Incident Timeline:** Track ongoing attacks and defensive responses
- **Stock Price Monitor:** Real-time company valuation feedback

### Advanced Defense Integration

**AI-Assisted Decision Making:**
- **Threat Prediction:** AI analyzes patterns to forecast likely attack vectors
- **Resource Optimization:** Automated suggestions for defensive resource allocation
- **Response Automation:** Configurable AI responses to routine threats
- **Learning Integration:** AI improves recommendations based on player success/failure

**Multi-Layer Defense Strategy:**
- **Perimeter Security:** Firewalls, IDS systems, network monitoring
- **Internal Monitoring:** Behavioral analysis, privilege management, data flow tracking  
- **Response Coordination:** Incident response teams, crisis management protocols
- **Recovery Planning:** Backup systems, disaster recovery, business continuity

**Integration with Idle Mode Systems:**
- Technologies developed in idle mode provide enhanced options in Admin's Watch
- Experience in Admin's Watch improves idle mode defensive automation
- Personnel can be shared between modes with appropriate cost/benefit trade-offs
- Research discoveries benefit both operational contexts

3. *Automatic:* Defenses handle routine threats automatically
4. *Autonomous:* AI makes all defense decisions independently
5. *Precognitive:* System prevents attacks before they're even planned

### Risk vs. Reward Systems
- Higher Security Rating reduces resource generation efficiency
- Operating in high-risk zones provides better rewards
- Some upgrades increase threat level but offer massive benefits
- Players can choose aggressive expansion or defensive consolidation strategies

## Threat Scaling & Balancing

### Dynamic Threat Level
- Base Threat Level = Player Net Worth ^ 0.75
- Zone modifiers apply additional multipliers
- Faction relations affect threat types and frequency
- Recent player actions influence threat targeting

### Defense Effectiveness
- Attack Success Chance = max(0, Threat Level - Security Rating × Defense Multipliers)
- Critical defense failures have cascading effects
- Overconfidence penalties for extremely high security ratings

## Mathematical Framework

### Threat Timing Calculations
```
Next Attack Time = Base Interval × (1 + Random(-0.3, +0.5)) × Zone Modifier × Faction Relations
```

### Defense Success Rate
```
Success Rate = min(95%, Security Rating / (Threat Level × Attack Sophistication))
```

### Damage Calculations
```
Damage = Base Threat Damage × (1 - Defense Effectiveness) × Critical Hit Multiplier
```

### Resource Loss Prevention
```
Protected Resources = Total Resources × min(0.9, Security Rating / Max Security Rating)
```
