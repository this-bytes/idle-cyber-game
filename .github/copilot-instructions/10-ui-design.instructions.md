# Visual Design & User Interface Goals

## Core Interface Principles

### Design Philosophy
- **Clean and Functional:** Prioritize clear display of information and easy access to buttons
- **Resource Display:** Prominently show current Data Bits, Data Bits/sec, Processing Power, and Security Rating
- **Upgrade Panels:** Clear sections for purchasing servers, processors, and defensive upgrades
- **Threat Indicator:** A visible, possibly flashing, alert when an attack is underway
- **Minimalist Aesthetic:** Leaning into a "digital interface" feel, with stark colors, pixel fonts, and simple icons

### Information Hierarchy
- **Critical Information:** Current attacks, low resources, urgent notifications (top priority)
- **Primary Information:** Current resources, generation rates, security status (always visible)
- **Secondary Information:** Available upgrades, achievement progress (expandable sections)
- **Detailed Information:** Statistics, analytics, detailed help (dedicated panels)
