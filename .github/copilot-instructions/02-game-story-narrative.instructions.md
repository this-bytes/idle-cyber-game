# Story & Narrative — Idle Sec Ops
Tone & Setting
- Style: Light cyberpunk/neo-noir with a retro-pixel hacker aesthetic.
- Presentation: Snappy text, short bursts of narrative, flavored with SOC humor (punny upgrades, playful cybersecurity jargon).
- Atmosphere: Players feel like a decisive Chief Security Officer running a growing SOC consultancy, handling both idle operations and sudden Incident bursts.
- Flavor Delivery: Incident Mode uses ASCII/terminal-style logs for immersion, while Idle HQ features quick one-liners, notifications, and playful flavor text.
Player Role & Arc
- Role: Player is Lead Security Principal / CEO of a boutique managed SOC.
- Progression Arc:
- Start: garage SOC with cobbled-together tools.
- Mid-game: mid-market clientele, recognizable contracts, expanded team and upgrades.
- Late-game: global-scale SOC with enterprise, government, and shadow clients.
- Narrative Growth: Company-tier expansion becomes the main narrative driver (garage → consultancy → global authority).
Clients & Faction
- Clients (Contracts): Provide revenue, XP, and reputation. Each has quirks (budget, risk appetite, tech stack).
- Factions (Industry Clusters): Shape the types of contracts, difficulty, and threats.
    - FinTech — fast cash, high fraud risk.
    - HealthTech — sensitive data, ransomware-prone.
    - Gov — reputation-heavy, lots of regulations.
    - Research Labs — advanced threats, espionage attempts.
    - Black Market — shady payouts, chaotic rewards/penalties.
    - Faction Impact: Each introduces unique threats, rewards, and challenges for variety and replayability.
Narrative Usage
- Minimal / Punchy: Story is not cutscene-heavy; it’s short bursts tied to progression.
Key Narrative Hooks:
- Onboarding: Tutorial in the garage SOC (simple intro to contracts, specialists, and first Incident).
- Client Intros: One-liners describing contract context.
- Active Mode Flavor: ASCII-style logs (escalation snippets, attacker signatures, resolution messages).
- Milestones: Celebratory text when hitting major goals (“First Fortune 500 secured,” “Global threat intel unlocked”).
- Tone: Witty and thematic, leaning on SOC humor, but always concise and localizable.
Accessibility & Localization
- Sentences capped short (1–2 lines).
- Simple vocabulary for easy localization and rapid data-file injection.
- Narrative delivered in small data files for flexible iteration.
Deliverables for Writer
- Clients: 1-line description for the first 10 (blurb-sized, mixing humor with SOC theme).
- Incident Events: 2–3 templates with detection, escalation snippets, and resolution text.
- Onboarding Script: A tight intro that:
    - Sets the garage SOC scene.
    - Introduces the HQ interface.
    - Walks through the first Incident event.
    - Unlocks the first contract client.
