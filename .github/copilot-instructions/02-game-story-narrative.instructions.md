# Story & Narrative — Cyber Empire Command

Tone & Setting
- Neo-noir, cyberpunk, hacker aesthetic with retro-pixel presentation. The game emphasizes being a fast-thinking Chief Security Officer running an expanding cybersecurity consultancy that takes contracts from a variety of clients (startups, enterprises, government).
- Keep text punchy and atmospheric — short narrative blurbs, ASCII-style terminal flavor for crisis play, and in-HQ flavor text for idle moments.

Player Role & Arc
- Player is the Lead Security Principal / CEO of a boutique cybersecurity firm.
- Arc: garage → local consultancy → global cyber-firm. Progression is company-tier based (small, mid-market, enterprise, government).

Clients & Factions
- Clients are the game's "contract engines" — each client has budget, risk, tech stack quirks, and reputation rewards.
- Factions are industry clusters (FinTech, HealthTech, Gov, Black Market, Research Labs). Faction relationships affect contract availability and threat types.
- Keep faction descriptions short and functional: how they change threats and rewards.

Narrative Usage
- Use story sparingly — short client intros, crisis flavor text, and milestone narration (e.g., "First Fortune 500 contract won").
- Crisis Mode uses terminal log narratives to present the attack and escalate tension (e.g., "APT-ShadowKnife detected attempting lateral movement on corp-db").

Accessibility & Localization
- Keep lines short. Use simple vocabulary for localization.
- Provide narrative as short strings in data files to make localization straightforward.

Deliverables for writers
- 1-line client descriptions for the first 10 clients
- 2–3 crisis templates (log snippets, escalation lines, success/failure messages)
- A short onboarding script that introduces the player to the HQ and their first crisis
