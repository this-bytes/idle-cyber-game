## Mathematical Foundations

**Base Generation Calculations:**
- Data Bits per second = (Base Server Output × Server Count × Processing Power Multiplier × Efficiency Rating)
- Processing Power growth = Exponential curve with diminishing returns after tier thresholds
- Security Rating = Sum of all defensive systems with diminishing returns formula

**Upgrade Cost Scaling:**
- Base Cost × (Growth Factor ^ Purchase Count) × Zone Difficulty Multiplier
- Growth factors vary by upgrade type (servers: 1.15, processing: 1.2, security: 1.25)
- Bulk purchase discounts available for certain upgrade types
