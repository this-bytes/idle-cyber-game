## Modular Instruction System

This project uses a comprehensive modular approach to copilot instructions. Each aspect of development has its own focused instruction file in the `.github/copilot-instructions/` directory:

### Core Development Files
- **[01-project-overview.instructions.md](./copilot-instructions/01-project-overview.instructions.md)** - Project goals, core principles, and development workflow
- **[12-development-roadmap.instructions.md](./copilot-instructions/12-development-roadmap.instructions.md)** - Development phases, git workflow, and testing strategy

### Game Design Files
- **[02-game-story-narrative.instructions.md](./copilot-instructions/02-game-story-narrative.instructions.md)** - World setting, player origins, factions, and narrative context
- **[03-core-mechanics.instructions.md](./copilot-instructions/03-core-mechanics.instructions.md)** - Resources, generation systems, and upgrade mechanics
- **[04-defense-threat-systems.instructions.md](./copilot-instructions/04-defense-threat-systems.instructions.md)** - Comprehensive threat classification and defense infrastructure
- **[05-progression-prestige.instructions.md](./copilot-instructions/05-progression-prestige.instructions.md)** - Character advancement, zones, achievements, and prestige systems
- **[06-events-encounters.instructions.md](./copilot-instructions/06-events-encounters.instructions.md)** - Dynamic events, random encounters, and faction relations
- **[07-endgame-meta.instructions.md](./copilot-instructions/07-endgame-meta.instructions.md)** - Singularity path, New Game Plus, and community features

### Technical Implementation Files
- **[08-quality-accessibility.instructions.md](./copilot-instructions/08-quality-accessibility.instructions.md)** - QoL features, automation, and accessibility options
- **[09-balancing-math.instructions.md](./copilot-instructions/09-balancing-math.instructions.md)** - Mathematical frameworks and balancing formulas
- **[10-ui-design.instructions.md](./copilot-instructions/10-ui-design.instructions.md)** - Visual design, audio concepts, and interface goals
- **[11-technical-architecture.instructions.md](./copilot-instructions/11-technical-architecture.instructions.md)** - Platform considerations and performance optimization

## Quick Start Guide

### For New Contributors
1. Read `01-project-overview.instructions.md` for core principles and workflow
2. Review `12-development-roadmap.instructions.md` for current development phase
3. Consult the relevant specialized instruction file for your area of work

### For Specific Development Tasks
- **Working on gameplay mechanics?** → `03-core-mechanics.instructions.md` + `04-defense-threat-systems.instructions.md`
- **Implementing UI/UX?** → `10-ui-design.instructions.md` + `08-quality-accessibility.instructions.md`
- **Balancing game systems?** → `09-balancing-math.instructions.md`
- **Adding story content?** → `02-game-story-narrative.instructions.md` + `06-events-encounters.instructions.md`
- **Working on progression?** → `05-progression-prestige.instructions.md` + `07-endgame-meta.instructions.md`
- **Technical implementation?** → `11-technical-architecture.instructions.md`
- **Developing "The Admin's Watch" mode?** → `02-game-story-narrative.instructions.md` + `03-core-mechanics.instructions.md` + `04-defense-threat-systems.instructions.md` + `10-ui-design.instructions.md`

## Current Development Phase

**Phase 1 - Foundation (Weeks 1-2):**
Currently building the basic game mechanics and core systems. Focus on:
- Basic resource generation and clicking mechanics
- Simple upgrade system
- Basic threat system
- Core UI framework

See `12-development-roadmap.instructions.md` for detailed phase breakdown and feature branches.

## Benefits of This Modular Approach

- **Focused Instructions:** Each file targets specific development aspects
- **Easier Maintenance:** Update individual sections without affecting others
- **Better Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on different aspects simultaneously
- **Specialized AI Guidance:** AI agents can receive targeted instructions for their specific tasks
- **Scalable Documentation:** Easy to add new instruction files as the project grows

When working on any aspect of the game, consult the appropriate instruction file for detailed, actionable guidance specific to that area of development.
