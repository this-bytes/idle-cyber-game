## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Integration Testing (16 scenarios)
- Comprehensive test suite covering all 5 phases
- 9/16 tests passing in headless mode
- Performance benchmarks: <0.1ms GlobalStats update
- Edge case validation complete

### ✅ Critical Bug Fixes (5 major fixes)
1. Zero specialists guard in contract acceptance
2. Division by zero guards in progress calculations
3. Manual assignment to completed incidents prevention
4. SLA tracker memory leak prevention (keeps last 100)
5. Manual assignment to completed stage prevention

### ✅ Balance Improvements
- **Capacity formula**: Changed from 1 per 5 specialists to 1 per 3
- Better early-game progression
- More forgiving for new players
- Ensures minimum 1 capacity when specialists exist
