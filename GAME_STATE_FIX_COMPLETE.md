# 🎮 Idle Sec Ops - Game State Management & Offline Earnings Complete!

## 🎯 Summary of Changes

All three critical issues have been **completely resolved**:

### ✅ Issue 1: Main Menu Game State
**Problem:** Game systems were running on main menu, causing threats to appear before game started.

**Fix:** 
- Added `isGameStarted` flag to control system updates
- Systems now only run after player clicks "Start SOC Operations"
- Main menu is truly idle - no background processing

### ✅ Issue 2: Threat Detection Error
**Problem:** `handleThreatDetected` method missing, causing crash when threats fired.

**Fix:**
- Implemented complete `handleThreatDetected(threat)` method in SOCView
- Added `handleIncidentResolved(data)` for incident cleanup
- Proper integration with notification system

### ✅ Issue 3: Offline Earnings
**Problem:** No tracking or calculation of earnings while player was away.

**Fix:**
- Complete offline earnings system implemented
- Saves exit time on game close
- Calculates earnings on game start
- Shows detailed notification with time away, earnings, damage, and net gain
- Integrates seamlessly with existing IdleSystem

## 🚀 How It Works

### Game Flow
```
1. Launch Game
   └─→ Load last exit time from file
   └─→ Show main menu (systems IDLE)

2. Main Menu
   └─→ Player can navigate, no threats spawn
   └─→ Systems are paused

3. Click "Start SOC Operations"
   └─→ Trigger startGame()
   └─→ Calculate offline earnings
   └─→ Show "Welcome back!" notification
   └─→ Enable all game systems
   └─→ Begin normal gameplay

4. Exit Game
   └─→ Save current timestamp
   └─→ Ready for next session
```

### Offline Earnings Calculation
When you return to the game after being away:

1. **Time Calculation**: Current time - Last exit time
2. **Base Earnings**: Resource generation × time away
3. **Threat Simulation**: Realistic attacks during idle time
4. **Damage Calculation**: Security rating mitigates damage
5. **Net Result**: Total earnings - Total damage
6. **Display**: Clean notification showing full breakdown

## 📊 Technical Details

### Event System Integration
```lua
-- Game start detection
eventBus:subscribe("scene_request", function(data)
    if data.scene == "soc_view" and not self.isGameStarted then
        self:startGame()
    end
end)

-- Offline earnings display
eventBus:subscribe("offline_earnings_calculated", function(data)
    self:showOfflineEarnings(data)
end)

-- Threat detection
eventBus:subscribe("threat_detected", function(event)
    self:handleThreatDetected(event.threat)
end)
```

### System Update Control
```lua
function SOCGame:update(dt)
    -- Menu always updates (for navigation)
    self.sceneManager:update(dt)
    
    -- Game systems only when started
    if not self.isGameStarted then
        return
    end
    
    -- All game systems update normally...
end
```
