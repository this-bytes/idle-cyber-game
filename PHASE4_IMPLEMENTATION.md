## Files Modified

### 1. `src/systems/incident_specialist_system.lua` (+88 lines)
**Purpose:** Add manual assignment capabilities to the incident system

**New Methods:**
- `getActiveIncidents()` - Returns array of all active incidents
- `getIncidentById(incidentId)` - Retrieves specific incident by ID
- `manualAssignSpecialist(specialistId, incidentId, stageName)` - Assigns specialist to incident stage
- `setSpecialistSystem(specialistSystem)` - Connects to specialist system for validation

**Event Subscriptions:**
- `manual_assignment_requested` - Triggers manual assignment workflow

**Key Features:**
- Validates specialist and incident existence before assignment
- Prevents duplicate assignments to same stage
- Tracks manual assignments separately from auto-assignments
- Publishes `specialist_manually_assigned` event on success

---

### 2. `src/systems/global_stats_system.lua` (+46 lines)
**Purpose:** Track manual assignment statistics and provide enhanced dashboard data

**New Statistics Section:**
```lua
manualAssignmentStats = {
    totalManualAssignments = 0,
    manualAssignmentSuccessRate = 0,
    averageManualAssignmentTime = 0,
    lastManualAssignment = nil
}
```

**New Methods:**
- `trackManualAssignment(data)` - Records manual assignment event
- `calculateWorkloadPercentage()` - Calculates workload as percentage of capacity

**Enhanced Dashboard Data:**
- `workloadPercentage` - Current workload as 0-1 ratio
- `slaComplianceRate` - SLA compliance rate (0-1)
- `activeContracts` - Number of active contracts
- `totalSpecialists` - Total active specialists
- `avgSpecialistLevel` - Average specialist level
- `avgResponseTime` - Average incident response time

**Event Subscriptions:**
- `specialist_manually_assigned` - Tracks manual assignments in statistics

---

### 3. `src/scenes/admin_mode_enhanced_luis.lua` (NEW FILE - 453 lines)
**Purpose:** Modern admin interface with manual assignment controls and performance dashboard

**Architecture:**
- Grid-based LUIS UI foundation with custom drawing for dynamic content
- Real-time event-driven updates
- Mouse-based interaction for manual assignments

**UI Sections:**

#### Performance Dashboard (Top Panel)
- 5 key metrics displayed with color coding:
  - Workload Status (OPTIMAL/HIGH/CRITICAL/OVERLOADED)
  - SLA Compliance Rate
  - Active Contracts Count
  - Specialists Count & Average Level
  - Average Response Time

#### Active Incidents List (Left Panel)
- Displays all active incidents with:
  - Threat type and current stage
  - Stage progress percentage
  - SLA timer (current/limit)
  - Assigned specialists names

#### Specialists Panel (Right Panel)
- Displays all available specialists with:
  - Name and level
  - Stats (Trace, Speed, Efficiency)
  - Workload indicator (color-coded)
  - Assignment button (when incident selected)

**Key Methods:**
- `refreshData()` - Fetches latest data from systems
- `drawPerformanceDashboard()` - Renders metrics panel
- `drawIncidentsList()` - Renders active incidents
- `drawSpecialistsPanel()` - Renders specialists list
- `mousepressed(x, y, button)` - Handles click interactions
- `manuallyAssignSpecialist()` - Triggers assignment workflow

**Event Flow:**
1. User clicks incident ‚Üí Sets `selectedIncident`
2. User clicks specialist ‚Üí Publishes `manual_assignment_requested`
3. IncidentSpecialistSystem processes assignment
4. Publishes `specialist_manually_assigned` event
5. GlobalStatsSystem tracks the assignment
6. UI auto-refreshes via event subscriptions

---

### 4. `src/soc_game.lua` (+6 lines)
**Purpose:** Register and initialize the enhanced admin mode scene

**Changes:**
- Added `require` for `AdminModeEnhanced` scene
- Registered scene as `"admin_mode_enhanced"`
- Connected IncidentSpecialistSystem to SpecialistSystem

---

### 5. `src/scenes/soc_view_luis.lua` (+4 lines)
**Purpose:** Add navigation to enhanced admin mode

**Changes:**
- Added "üîß Enhanced Admin" button to main SOC view
- Publishes `request_scene_change` to navigate to admin mode

---

### 6. `tests/integration/test_phase4_admin_enhanced.lua` (NEW FILE - 260 lines)
**Purpose:** Integration test suite for Phase 4 features

**Test Coverage:**
1. IncidentSpecialistSystem loads successfully
2. All new methods exist (getActiveIncidents, getIncidentById, etc.)
3. GlobalStatsSystem loads with manual assignment tracking
4. Manual assignment stats structure is correct
5. trackManualAssignment() method works
6. Enhanced dashboard data includes new fields
7. AdminModeEnhanced scene loads successfully
8. Scene can be instantiated
9. Scene has required methods
10. Event flow works end-to-end
11. Manual assignment triggers correct events

## Technical Approach

### UI Framework Adaptation
The problem statement specified a widget-based UI framework (Panel, ScrollPanel) that doesn't exist in the repository. The implementation was adapted to use the actual **grid-based LUIS framework** while maintaining all required functionality:

- **Grid-based layout** for static elements (title, buttons)
- **Manual drawing** for dynamic content (incidents, specialists)
- **Mouse coordinate detection** for click interactions
- **Event-driven updates** for real-time synchronization

### Architectural Compliance
Following the repository's "Golden Rules":
‚úÖ Source of truth in `src/systems` (IncidentSpecialistSystem, GlobalStatsSystem)
‚úÖ Event-driven communication via EventBus
‚úÖ Data-driven metrics and statistics
‚úÖ Modern scene pattern following existing LUIS scenes
‚úÖ No modifications to deprecated code paths

---

## Usage Guide

### Accessing Enhanced Admin Mode
1. Launch the game
2. Navigate to SOC View
3. Click "üîß Enhanced Admin" button
4. Enhanced Admin Mode interface loads

### Manual Assignment Workflow
1. **Select an Incident**: Click on an incident card in the left panel
2. **Select a Specialist**: Scroll through specialists in the right panel
3. **Assign**: Click the "ASSIGN TO [INCIDENT]" button on the specialist card
4. **Confirmation**: Specialist is assigned and incident list updates

### Performance Dashboard
The top panel displays real-time metrics:
- **Green** indicators = Good performance
- **Yellow** indicators = Warning state
- **Red** indicators = Critical state

### Navigation
