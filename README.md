# Idle Sec Ops - Idle Cybersecurity Game

A comprehensive idle cybersecurity simulation built with Lua and LÃ–VE 2D, featuring modern fortress architecture, authentic threat modeling, and a production-ready Smart UI Framework.

## ðŸŽ¨ NEW: Smart UI Framework - FULLY INTEGRATED! âœ…

**The Smart UI Framework is now integrated into the game!** ðŸŽ‰

- âœ… **Component-Based Architecture** - Automatic layout with flexbox/grid
- âœ… **Toast Notifications** - Animated notifications with auto-dismiss
- âœ… **Main Menu** - Rebuilt with Smart UI components
- âœ… **SOC View** - Complete game interface with Smart UI
- âœ… **Viewport Management** - ScrollContainer prevents off-screen rendering
- âœ… **Interactive Elements** - Buttons with hover effects
- âœ… **Cyberpunk Styling** - Neon borders, glow effects, cut corners

**Try the Integration Demo:**
```bash
love integration_demo_dir  # Interactive showcase
```

**See It In Action:**
```bash
love .  # Game now uses Smart UI!
```

## Architecture Overview

### Fortress Architecture (Recommended)
Modern, production-ready architecture with industry-standard SOLID design principles:

- **GameLoop**: Central system orchestration with priority-based updates
- **ResourceManager**: Unified resource handling (money, reputation, XP, mission tokens)
- **SecurityUpgrades**: Authentic cybersecurity infrastructure with 4 categories
- **ThreatSimulation**: Realistic threat engine with 8 threat types
- **UIManager**: Modern reactive UI with cybersecurity theming
- **FortressGame**: Clean controller replacing monolithic game.lua

### Legacy Systems (Maintained)
Original systems maintained for backward compatibility:
- Location-based progression with JSON configuration
- Contract and specialist management systems
- Achievement and skill progression systems

## Running the Game

### Fortress Edition (Recommended)
```bash
love .                    # Uses fortress_main.lua automatically
lua5.3 fortress_main.lua  # Direct fortress execution
```

### Legacy Edition  
```bash
lua5.3 main.lua          # Original monolithic version
```

## Testing

```bash
lua5.3 tests/test_runner.lua  # Runs all 46 tests (42 pass, 4 legacy issues)
```

**Test Coverage**:
- âœ… 12 fortress architecture tests (all passing)
- âœ… 34 legacy system tests (30 passing, 4 known issues)
- âœ… Integration tests for fortress-legacy compatibility

## Development

This project follows a Git-first workflow with feature branches for each major system. See `.github/copilot-instructions/12-development-roadmap.instructions.md` for detailed development guidelines.

## Architecture

The game is built with a modular architecture allowing easy expansion and maintenance. Each major system is self-contained with clear interfaces.
