## Architecture Overview

### Modern Game Architecture (Current)
Production-ready architecture implementing industry-standard SOLID design principles:

- **GameLoop**: Central system orchestration with priority-based updates
- **ResourceManager**: Unified resource handling (money, reputation, XP, mission tokens)
- **SecurityUpgrades**: Authentic cybersecurity infrastructure with 4 categories
- **ThreatSimulation**: Realistic threat engine with 8 threat types
- **UIManager**: Modern reactive UI with cybersecurity theming
- **SOCGame**: Main game controller integrating all systems

See [11-technical-architecture.instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions/11-technical-architecture.instructions.md) for complete details.

## Running the Game

### Main Edition  
```bash
lua5.3 main.lua          # Original monolithic version
```

## Testing

```bash
lua5.3 tests/test_runner.lua  # Runs all 46 tests (42 pass, 4 legacy issues)
```


### Screenshot tool behavior

When running under a LÃ–VE runtime the project uses the engine's screenshot APIs.
When running tests or scripts under plain Lua (CI or dev scripts) the
`tools/screenshot_tool.lua` module falls back to writing a small PNG file into
the current working directory so tests can assert on an actual image file
instead of a textual placeholder. The tool also clears previously generated
timestamped screenshots (e.g. `screenshot_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png`) before each
fallback run so tests start from a clean state.



## Development

This project follows a Git-first workflow with feature branches for each major system. See `.github/copilot-instructions/12-development-roadmap.instructions.md` for detailed development guidelines.

## Architecture

The game is built with a modular architecture allowing easy expansion and maintenance. Each major system is self-contained with clear interfaces.
