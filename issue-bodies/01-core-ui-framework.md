## Description
Implement the foundational user interface framework for the Cyberspace Tycoon idle game using LÖVE 2D. This provides the basic structure for all game screens and UI elements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Game window opens with proper dimensions (800x600 minimum)
- [ ] Basic UI layout with resource display area at top
- [ ] Button system for upgrades and actions
- [ ] Text rendering system for game information
- [ ] Color scheme matches cybersecurity theme (dark background, green/blue accents)
- [ ] Responsive layout that scales properly

## Technical Requirements
- **Engine:** LÖVE 2D (Lua)
- **Resolution:** 800x600 minimum, scalable
- **Font:** Monospace font for digital/terminal feel
- **Color Palette:** Dark theme with cybersecurity colors
- **UI Components:** Buttons, text labels, progress bars, panels

## Implementation Notes
- Reference `.github/copilot-instructions/10-ui-design.md` for visual guidelines
- Follow the minimalist aesthetic outlined in the documentation
- Create reusable UI components for consistency
- Implement basic input handling (mouse clicks, keyboard)
- Use LÖVE 2D's built-in GUI capabilities
