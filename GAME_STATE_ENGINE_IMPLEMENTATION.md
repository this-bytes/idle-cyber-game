# Game State Engine Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement

We needed a game state engine that handles:
- Resource generation tracking
- Persistent state across game sessions
- Offline earnings calculation on startup
- Automatic periodic saves
- State loading when the game runs

## Solution

Created a comprehensive **GameStateEngine** system that provides:

### 1. Centralized State Management
- Single source of truth for all game state
- Manages state for all registered game systems
- Supports both `getState()/loadState()` and `getSaveData()/loadSaveData()` patterns
- Automatic collection of state from all systems

### 2. Persistent Save/Load
- Saves to JSON format for human-readable saves
- Automatic save file management in LÖVE save directory
- Version tracking for compatibility
- Error handling and validation
- State export/import functionality

### 3. Offline Earnings Calculation
- Calculates resource generation while player is away
- Simulates cyber threats and damage realistically
- Applies damage caps to prevent complete loss
- Publishes events for UI notification
- Integrates with existing IdleSystem

### 4. Automated Saving
- Periodic auto-save (default: 60 seconds, configurable)
- Save on exit (quick save)
- Configurable auto-save interval (minimum 10 seconds)
- Enable/disable auto-save functionality
- Save event notifications

### 5. State Validation & Error Recovery
- Version compatibility checks
- Graceful handling of missing systems
- Error catching for state operations
- Fallback behavior for corrupted saves
- Comprehensive logging

   - Enables proper save/load testing

4. **.gitignore**
   - Added game_state.json, last_exit.dat, cyberspace_tycoon_save.json
   - Prevents save files from being committed

5. **README.md**
   - Added GameStateEngine to architecture overview
   - Added link to GAME_STATE_ENGINE.md documentation

## Key Features Implemented

### Resource Generation Tracking
- Integrated with ResourceManager's existing generation system
- Tracks generation rates and multipliers
- Persists generation state across sessions
- Updates in real-time during gameplay

### Offline Earnings
- Uses IdleSystem to calculate realistic offline progress
- Factors in:
  - Resource generation rates
  - Security infrastructure (upgrades, defenses)
  - Threat simulation (attacks while away)
  - Damage mitigation based on player's security
- Applies damage caps (10%-30% based on security rating)
- Publishes detailed offline earnings event

### Automated Saves
- Auto-save every 60 seconds (configurable)
- Save on game exit
- Non-blocking save operations
- Save event notifications for UI feedback
- Manual quick save available

### State Persistence
- Complete game state saved to JSON
- Includes all registered systems:
  - ResourceManager (money, reputation, XP, etc.)
  - SkillSystem
  - UpgradeSystem
  - SpecialistSystem
  - ContractSystem
  - ThreatSystem
  - IdleSystem
  - AchievementSystem
- Version tracking for save compatibility
- Human-readable format for debugging

## Testing Results

### Unit Tests (10/10 passing)
✅ Initialization
✅ System Registration
✅ Get Complete State
✅ Load Complete State
✅ Save and Load State
✅ Auto-save Configuration
✅ State Summary
✅ Export and Import State
✅ Reset State
✅ Update with Auto-save

### Integration Tests (5/5 passing)

✅ Auto-save Functionality
✅ State Persistence Across Sessions
✅ Multiple System State Management

## API Highlights

```lua
-- Initialization
local engine = GameStateEngine.new(eventBus)
engine:registerSystem("resourceManager", resourceManager)

-- Save/Load
engine:saveState()           -- Save current state
engine:loadState()           -- Load from file
engine:quickSave()           -- Immediate save

-- Offline Earnings
local progress = engine:calculateOfflineEarnings()
-- Returns: {idleTime, earnings, damage, netGain, events}

-- Configuration
engine:setAutoSave(true)     -- Enable/disable
engine:setAutoSaveInterval(120)  -- Set interval

-- State Management
local summary = engine:getStateSummary()
local json = engine:exportState()
engine:importState(json)
engine:resetState()
```

## Events Published

1. **game_state_saved** - When state is saved
2. **game_state_loaded** - When state is loaded
3. **offline_earnings_calculated** - When offline progress is calculated
4. **game_state_reset** - When state is reset

## Benefits

1. **Unified State Management**: Single system handles all persistence
2. **Automatic**: No manual save/load code needed in game systems
3. **Extensible**: Easy to add new systems, just register them
4. **Testable**: Comprehensive test coverage
5. **Debuggable**: Human-readable JSON saves
6. **Robust**: Error handling and version compatibility
7. **Event-Driven**: UI can respond to state changes
8. **Documented**: Complete API reference and examples

## Usage in Game

The player experience is now:

1. **Start Game**: Load saved state automatically
2. **See Progress**: Offline earnings calculated and displayed
3. **Play**: State auto-saves every 60 seconds
4. **Exit**: State saved on shutdown
5. **Return**: All progress preserved, offline earnings calculated

## Integration Points

The GameStateEngine integrates with:

- **SOCGame**: Main game controller
- **ResourceManager**: Resource tracking and generation
- **IdleSystem**: Offline progress calculation
- **All Game Systems**: State persistence
- **EventBus**: State change notifications
- **LÖVE Filesystem**: Save file management

## Performance

- **Save Operations**: O(n) where n = number of systems
- **Load Operations**: O(n) where n = number of systems
- **Auto-save**: Configurable interval (default 60s)
- **Memory**: Minimal overhead, state collected on-demand
- **Disk I/O**: Single file write per save

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements documented in GAME_STATE_ENGINE.md:
- Cloud saves
- Compression
- Encryption
- Automatic save migration
- Backup system
- Delta saves
- Async operations

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains compatibility with:
- Existing save_system.lua (can coexist)
- Legacy getSaveData/loadSaveData methods
- Existing exit time tracking (kept for compatibility)
- All existing game systems (non-breaking changes)

## Summary

The GameStateEngine provides a complete, production-ready state management solution that:
- Handles all persistence requirements
- Calculates offline earnings accurately
- Auto-saves periodically
- Is well-tested (15 tests, all passing)
- Is fully documented
- Integrates cleanly with existing code
- Requires minimal changes to game systems

The implementation fulfills all requirements from the problem statement and provides a robust foundation for game state management.
