# Resource Display System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Issue #6 - Resource Display System for the Cyberspace Tycoon idle cybersecurity game. The system provides real-time display of resources with smooth animations, proper number formatting, and extensible architecture.

## Features Implemented

### Core Resource Management (`resources.lua`)
- **Data Bits (DB)**: Primary currency with click-to-earn mechanics
- **Processing Power (PP)**: Computational resource that multiplies DB generation
- **Security Rating (SR)**: Defensive strength metric
- **Click Mechanics**: Combo system with critical hits (5% chance for 10x reward)
- **Upgrade System**: Scalable infrastructure and processing upgrades
- **Generation Rates**: Automatic resource generation based on owned upgrades

### Number Formatting System (`format.lua`)
- **Large Number Support**: Formats numbers with suffixes (K, M, B, T, Qa, Qi, etc.)
- **Precision Control**: Appropriate decimal places based on number magnitude
- **Specialized Formatters**: Currency, rates, percentages, multipliers, time duration
- **Color Coding**: Different colors for different resource types
- **Animation Support**: Functions for smooth number transitions

### Visual Display System (`display.lua`)
- **Resource Panels**: Clean, organized display of current resources and generation rates
- **Real-time Updates**: Smooth animations for changing values
- **Click Effects**: Visual feedback for click actions with combo and critical indicators
- **Performance Tracking**: FPS counter and debug information
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Interactive Elements**: Clickable resource panel for earning Data Bits

### Upgrade Shop System (`shop.lua`)
- **Categorized Upgrades**: Infrastructure, Processing, and Clicking categories
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Costs scale with number owned (15-20% increase per purchase)
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded affordability, owned counts, descriptions
- **Tab Interface**: Easy navigation between upgrade categories
- **One-time Purchases**: Some upgrades (like peripherals) can only be bought once

### Main Game Integration (`main.lua`)
- **LÃ–VE 2D Framework**: Proper integration with game engine
- **Input Handling**: Mouse clicks, keyboard shortcuts
- **Performance Monitoring**: Frame time tracking and optimization
- **Debug Features**: Toggle stats, FPS, debug mode, compact mode

## Technical Features

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient animation system using linear interpolation
- Minimal memory allocation during gameplay
- Optimized rendering with proper color and font caching
- Performance monitoring and frame time tracking

### Accessibility Features
- Keyboard shortcuts for all major functions
- Alternative click methods (spacebar)
- Toggleable compact mode
- Clear visual indicators and feedback

### Extensibility
- Modular architecture allows easy addition of new resources
- Upgrade system supports multiple effect types
- Display system can accommodate new UI elements
- Number formatting handles arbitrary magnitude numbers

## Controls
- **Mouse Click**: Click resource panel to earn Data Bits
- **U**: Toggle upgrade shop
- **S**: Toggle detailed statistics
- **F**: Toggle FPS counter
- **D**: Toggle debug mode
- **C**: Toggle compact mode
- **P**: Pause/unpause game
- **Space**: Alternative click method
- **R**: Reset game (debug mode only)
- **Escape**: Quit game

## Architecture Benefits
1. **Modular Design**: Each system is self-contained and reusable
2. **Clean Separation**: Resources, display, formatting, and shop are independent
3. **Extensible**: Easy to add new resources, upgrades, or display elements
4. **Performant**: Optimized for smooth 60fps gameplay
5. **Maintainable**: Well-documented code with clear responsibilities

## Testing Results
- Game launches successfully without errors
- All user interface elements respond correctly
- Resource generation and display work in real-time
- Upgrade system functions properly with cost scaling
- Performance is excellent with smooth animations
- Number formatting handles large values correctly

## Next Steps
The resource display system is complete and ready for integration with additional game features such as:
- Threat system integration
- Achievement tracking
- Save/load functionality
- More advanced upgrade trees
- Prestige system support

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the idle cybersecurity game's core mechanics and user interface.
