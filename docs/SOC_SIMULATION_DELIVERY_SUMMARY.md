## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Dedicated SLA System** ✅
**Decision**: Create separate `SLASystem` module instead of embedding in ContractSystem

**Rationale**:
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Easier testing and debugging
- Can track SLAs across multiple systems (contracts, incidents, specialists)
- Follows project's modular architecture pattern

---

### 2. **Three-Stage Incident Lifecycle** ✅
**Decision**: Detect → Respond → Resolve with independent SLA tracking per stage

**Rationale**:
- Provides granular performance metrics
- Allows stage-specific specialist assignment
- Enables detailed analytics and feedback
- Creates interesting tactical gameplay (admin mode)

---

### 3. **Event-Driven Integration** ✅
**Decision**: All inter-system communication via EventBus

**Rationale**:
- Maintains project's architectural pattern
- Decouples systems for easier testing
- Allows systems to be developed independently
- Extensible for future features

---

### 4. **Data-Driven Configuration** ✅
**Decision**: SLA requirements, rewards, penalties all in JSON

**Rationale**:
- Easy balancing without code changes
- Supports mod-friendly design
- Consistent with project's data-driven approach
- Allows runtime configuration changes

---

### 5. **Weighted Compliance Score** ✅
**Decision**: Compliance = (Success Rate × 70%) + (Timing × 30%)

**Rationale**:
- Success rate is most important (getting job done)
- Timing matters but not as much (how quickly)
- Provides balanced performance metric
- Allows some flexibility in timing if success rate is high
