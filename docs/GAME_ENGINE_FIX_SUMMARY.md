# Game Engine Fix Summary - Income Generation Restored ✅

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

The core idle game loop is now **fully functional**. Income generates correctly from contracts, and players can progress through the game.

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### Critical Bug #1: Dictionary Length Check (contract_system.lua)
**Problem**: Used `#` operator on dictionary, which always returns 0  
**Fix**: Replaced with proper `pairs()` iteration  
**Impact**: Income calculation now executes correctly

### Critical Bug #2: Game Systems Never Started (soc_game.lua)
**Problem**: `isGameStarted` was never set to true  
**Fix**: Added event subscription to start game when entering soc_view scene  
**Impact**: All gameplay systems now receive update() calls

### Bug #3: Invalid IdleSystem Update Call (soc_game.lua)
**Problem**: Called `idleSystem:update()` which doesn't exist  
**Fix**: Removed the invalid call  
**Impact**: No more crashes when systems start

## ✅ Verification
