## Game Overview

SOC Joker is a fast-paced card game where you manage cybersecurity breach containment runs. Build your deck of specialists and tools to defeat increasingly difficult waves of threats.

### Core Loop

```

Each wave, you play cards from your hand to defeat threats. Between waves, you visit the shop to strengthen your deck. Complete all 3 waves to win!

## Game Mechanics
