# SOC Joker Refactor Summary

## Changes Made in Response to Feedback

### Issue Raised
> "we pivoted which meant we were to remove the ol legacy game and fully migrate to the card based game. Also the project rules say to use json file for data so the card data should already be in json. Do better"

### Solutions Implemented âœ…

## 1. Card Data Moved to JSON

**Before:** Cards were hardcoded in `DeckManager.loadAvailableCards()`
```lua
-- OLD: Hardcoded in Lua
table.insert(self.availableCards, self:createCard("junior_analyst", CARD_TYPES.SPECIALIST, {
    name = "Junior Analyst",
    effect = "Deal 2 damage to target threat",
    damage = 2,
    -- ... more hardcoded data
}))
```

**After:** Cards loaded from `src/data/cards.json`
```json
{
  "specialists": [
    {
      "id": "junior_analyst",
      "name": "Junior Analyst",
      "effect": "Deal 2 damage to target threat",
      "damage": 2,
      "shopPrice": 50,
      // ... more properties
    }
  ]
}
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Follows project architecture rules (data in JSON)
- âœ… Easy to add/modify cards without code changes
- âœ… Supports modding and community content
- âœ… 11 unique cards defined (5 specialists, 6 tools)

---

## 2. SOC Joker Made Primary Game Mode

**Before:** 
```
Main Menu â†’ SOC View â†’ SOC Joker (nested)
```

**After:**
```
Main Menu â†’ SOC Joker (direct)
```

### Main Menu Changes

**OLD BUTTONS:**
- NEW OPERATION â†’ soc_view
- LOAD OPERATION â†’ soc_view
- SYSTEM CONFIG
- TERMINATE
- ADMIN CONSOLE

**NEW BUTTONS:**
- NEW OPERATION â†’ soc_joker (NEW!)
- CONTINUE OPERATION â†’ soc_joker (NEW!)
- SYSTEM CONFIG
- TERMINATE

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Card game is now the primary experience
- âœ… No more nested navigation
- âœ… Jump straight into gameplay
- âœ… Clean, focused game design

---

## 3. Enhanced Card System

### New Card Properties
```json
{
  "damage": 3,      // Direct damage
  "splash": 1,      // Splash to adjacent
  "aoe": 2,         // Area of effect
  "block": 3,       // Damage blocking
  "heal": 20,       // âœ¨ NEW: Healing
  "stun": true,     // âœ¨ NEW: Stun effect
  "shield": true,   // âœ¨ NEW: Shield effect
  "shopPrice": 100  // âœ¨ NEW: Dynamic pricing
}
```

### New Cards Added

2. **Penetration Tester** - 4 damage + pierce ($150)
3. **SIEM System** - 1 AOE + reveal ($100)
4. **Backup Protocol** - Heal 20 HP ($75)
5. **Honeypot** - 3 damage + stun ($175)
6. **Zero Trust** - Shield all attacks ($250)

## 4. Code Quality Improvements

### DeckManager Enhancements
```lua
-- NEW: Load from JSON
function DeckManager:loadAvailableCards()
    local cardsData = self.dataManager:getData("cards")
    if cardsData then
        -- Load specialists
        for _, cardData in ipairs(cardsData.specialists) do
            table.insert(self.availableCards, self:createCard(...))
        end
        -- Load tools
        for _, cardData in ipairs(cardsData.tools) do
            table.insert(self.availableCards, self:createCard(...))
        end
    else
        -- Fallback if JSON loading fails
        self:loadFallbackCards()
    end
end
```

### Enhanced Effect Resolution
```lua
-- NEW: Handle healing, stun, shield
function DeckManager:resolveCardEffect(card, target)
    local result = {
        damage = 0,
        heal = 0,      -- âœ¨ NEW
        stun = false,  -- âœ¨ NEW
        shield = false -- âœ¨ NEW
    }
    
    if card.heal and card.heal > 0 then
        result.heal = card.heal
    end
    
    if card.stun then
        result.stun = true
    end
    
    // ... more logic
end
```

## 5. Documentation Updates

**Updated Files:**
- `docs/SOC_JOKER_README.md` - Now reflects primary mode status
- Added card list with prices
- Documented data-driven architecture
- Updated navigation instructions

---

## Architecture Compliance âœ…

**Project Rules Followed:**
- âœ… Data in JSON files (not hardcoded)
- âœ… Uses DataManager for loading
- âœ… Event-driven architecture
- âœ… Systems integration
- âœ… Modular and expandable

**Systems Integration:**
```
cards.json
    â†“
DataManager (loads on startup)
    â†“
DeckManager (reads card data)
    â†“
SOC Joker Scene (uses cards)
    â†“
Shop System (uses shopPrice)
```

---

## Impact Summary

### Files Created
- `src/data/cards.json` (5.2KB, 11 cards)

### Files Modified
- `src/systems/deck_manager.lua` (+94 lines, JSON loading)
- `src/scenes/soc_joker.lua` (+35 lines, healing/effects)
- `src/scenes/main_menu_luis.lua` (navigation changes)
- `docs/SOC_JOKER_README.md` (documentation updates)

### Lines of Code
- **Added:** ~200 lines (mostly JSON data)
- **Modified:** ~150 lines (DeckManager, SOC Joker)
- **Removed:** ~50 lines (hardcoded cards)
