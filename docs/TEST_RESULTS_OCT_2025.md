## Bugs Fixed During Testing

### 1. IdleSystem Constructor Variable Mismatch ✅ FIXED
**File**: `src/systems/idle_system.lua:22`  
**Issue**: Constructor parameter `resourceManager` was incorrectly assigned to `self.resourceSystem = resourceSystem` (undefined variable)  
**Fix**: Changed to `self.resourceSystem = resourceManager`  
**Impact**: IdleSystem can now correctly calculate offline earnings

### 2. ContractSystem Constructor Signature Changed ✅ FIXED
**File**: `tests/test_game_mechanics.lua:29`  
**Issue**: Test was calling old 7-argument constructor, but SystemRegistry refactor changed it to 5 arguments  
**Old**: `ContractSystem.new(eventBus, dataManager, upgradeSystem, specialistSystem, nil, nil, resourceManager)`  
**New**: `ContractSystem.new(eventBus, dataManager, resourceManager, upgradeSystem, specialistSystem)`  
**Fix**: Updated test to use new argument order  
**Impact**: ContractSystem now has access to ResourceManager for income generation

### 3. Specialist Count Check Used Array Length on Dictionary ✅ FIXED
**File**: `src/systems/contract_system.lua:296`  
**Issue**: Code used `#self.specialistSystem.specialists` which returns 0 for Lua dictionaries/tables  
**Fix**: Changed to proper dictionary iteration:
```lua
for _ in pairs(self.specialistSystem.specialists) do
    specialistCount = specialistCount + 1
end
```
**Impact**: ContractSystem can now correctly detect when specialists are available

### 4. UpgradeSystem Missing getEffectValue Method ✅ FIXED
**File**: `src/systems/contract_system.lua:560`  
**Issue**: Code called `self.upgradeSystem:getEffectValue()` but method doesn't exist  
**Fix**: Added safety check: `if self.upgradeSystem and self.upgradeSystem.getEffectValue then`  
**Impact**: ContractSystem won't crash when calculating capacity bonuses
**Note**: This is a **temporary fix**. The proper solution is to integrate EffectProcessor for effect calculations.

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### State Persistence Warnings ⚠️
Several systems are missing `getState()`/`loadState()` methods, preventing proper save/load:
- UpgradeSystem
- AchievementSystem
- EventSystem
- LocationSystem
- InputSystem
- ParticleSystem
- ClickRewardSystem

**Impact**: These systems will lose state on game save/load  
**Priority**: Medium - Should be added for player progression persistence

### Effect System Integration Gap 🔧
The UpgradeSystem doesn't integrate with the EffectProcessor utility, requiring ContractSystem to have a workaround check for `getEffectValue()`.

**Impact**: Upgrade effects may not be properly calculated across all systems  
**Priority**: High - Core gameplay mechanic  
**Recommendation**: Add EffectProcessor integration to UpgradeSystem or create a wrapper method

### Upgrade Trees Showing "0 trees" 🤔
```
🔧 Upgrade system initialized with 54 upgrades in 0 trees.
```

**Impact**: Unknown - upgrades still work, but tree structure may be broken  
**Priority**: Medium - Investigate if upgrade dependencies/unlocks are working  
**Next Step**: Review upgrade data schema and tree building logic

## System Architecture Verification ✅

The automated SystemRegistry successfully discovered and initialized **23 systems** in correct dependency order:

**Priority 1-10 (Core Infrastructure):**
1. DataManager (priority 1)
2. ResourceManager (priority 2)
3. SkillSystem (priority 10)

**Priority 15-50 (Mid-level Systems):**
4. UpgradeSystem (priority 15)
5. SpecialistSystem (priority 20)
6. ThreatSystem (priority 30)
7. ContractSystem (priority 50)

**Priority 60-100 (High-level Features):**
8. IdleSystem (priority 60)
9. AchievementSystem (priority 70)
10. All others (priority 100)

**Verdict**: ✅ Dependency injection and auto-discovery working as designed

3. Refine balance and progression
4. Add polish and UI improvements

The foundation is **stable and ready for expansion**.
