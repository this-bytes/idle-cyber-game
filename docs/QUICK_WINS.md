# 🎯 Quick Wins - What to Do Next Session

## 🔥 Top 3 Priorities (Do These First!)

### 1. Fix Specialist Hiring (30 minutes)
**Problem:** The `generateAvailableSpecialist` method isn't working right.

**Solution:**
```lua
-- In specialist_system.lua, make sure it returns the specialist
function SpecialistSystem:generateAvailableSpecialist(type)
    -- existing code...
    return specialist -- ADD THIS LINE
end
```

Then in engaging_soc_view.lua, simplify the hiring:
```lua
-- Just add the specialist directly with proper ID
local newId = self.systems.specialistSystem.nextSpecialistId
self.systems.specialistSystem:addSpecialist(type, {
    id = newId,
    type = type,
    name = "Security Intern",
    -- ... rest of stats
})
```

**Result:** Players can actually hire people! 🎉

---

### 2. Add Sound Effects (1 hour)
**Why:** Sound makes EVERYTHING better!

**What to add:**
```lua
-- In resource_manager.lua
if amount > 0 then
    love.audio.newSource("assets/sounds/coin.wav", "static"):play()
end

-- In engaging_soc_view.lua for button clicks
love.audio.newSource("assets/sounds/click.wav", "static"):play()
```

**Free sound sources:**
- https://freesound.org
- Search: "coin sound", "button click", "success"
- Use short (<1 second) .wav or .ogg files

**Result:** Immediate 50% more satisfying! 🔊

---

### 3. Add Achievement Popups (1 hour)
**Why:** Celebrate player milestones!

**Create:** `src/ui/achievement_popup.lua`
```lua
-- Simple popup that slides in from top
-- Shows achievement icon + text
-- Fades out after 3 seconds
```

**Achievements to add:**
- "First $1,000 Earned"
- "First Specialist Hired"
- "First Contract Completed"
- "Money Millionaire" ($1M earned)
- "Team of 5" (5 specialists)

**Result:** Players feel progress! 🏆

## 🎨 Polish (Do Last)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### When Adding Features:
1. **Test immediately** - Don't code for 30 minutes then test
2. **One thing at a time** - Fix hiring BEFORE adding sound
3. **Console.log everything** - `print("DEBUG: variable = " .. tostring(var))`
4. **Save often** - Git commit after each working feature

### When Things Break:
1. **Read the error** - Lua errors are usually clear
2. **Check line numbers** - Go to exact line in error
3. **Verify assumptions** - Is that variable actually a table?
4. **Add print statements** - Debug by printing values
