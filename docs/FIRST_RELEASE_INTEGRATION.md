# First Full Game Release - Integration Summary

## 🎉 What We Accomplished

This integration brings together all the core systems, scenes, and UI components to create a **playable, cohesive game experience** for the first release. The focus was on connectivity and making the game feel alive, not on polish or perfection.

---

## 🔧 Critical System Fixes

### 1. **Game Loop Integration** (`src/soc_game.lua`)
**Problem**: Core gameplay systems (ContractSystem, ThreatSystem, EventSystem, etc.) were registered but **never being updated**. Only the GameStateEngine:update() was called.

**Solution**: Added individual system updates to the main game loop:
```lua
if self.systems.contractSystem then self.systems.contractSystem:update(dt) end
if self.systems.threatSystem then self.systems.threatSystem:update(dt) end
if self.systems.eventSystem then self.systems.eventSystem:update(dt) end
if self.systems.specialistSystem then self.systems.specialistSystem:update(dt) end
if self.systems.idleSystem then self.systems.idleSystem:update(dt) end
if self.systems.achievementSystem then self.systems.achievementSystem:update(dt) end
```

**Impact**: ⚠️ **CRITICAL FIX** - This makes the game actually *work*. Contracts now generate income, threats appear, events trigger, etc.
