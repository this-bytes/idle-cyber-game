## 🚀 What Was Built

### 1. Headless Mock Environment
**File**: `tests/headless_mock.lua`

Provides complete LÖVE API mocking for headless test execution:
- **love.filesystem**: File I/O using standard Lua + shell commands
  - `getInfo()`, `read()`, `write()`, `getDirectoryItems()`
- **love.timer**: Time tracking using `os.clock()`
  - `getTime()`, `getFPS()`
- **love.graphics**: No-op rendering mocks
  - Font handling, drawing functions, window dimensions

### 2. Test Runner
**File**: `tests/run_mechanics_tests.lua`

Orchestrates test execution:
- Initializes mocks BEFORE loading game code
- Executes all test methods
- Reports detailed pass/fail status
- Returns proper exit codes for CI integration

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite
**File**: `tests/test_game_mechanics.lua`

**7 Test Methods Validating Core Mechanics:**

#### Test 1: Idle Income Generation ✅
- Simulates 60 seconds of idle gameplay
- Validates passive money generation
- Verifies income rates from IdleSystem

#### Test 2: Contract Lifecycle (Tycoon) ✅
- Tests time-based contract generation
- Validates manual contract acceptance
- Verifies contract completion and payouts
- Tests specialist XP gain from contracts

#### Test 3: Specialist Progression (RPG) ✅
- Awards XP to specialists
- Validates level-up mechanics
- Verifies skill unlocking system
- Tests stat increases on level-up

#### Test 4: Threat Resolution (RTS) ✅
- Generates threats from template pool
- Validates specialist assignment
- Tests threat damage and resolution
- Verifies reward distribution

#### Test 5: Incident System Integration ✅
- Validates IncidentSpecialistSystem initialization
- Tests auto-resolve mechanics
- Verifies threat detection and handling

#### Test 6: Resource Flow Integrity ✅
- Tests resource addition (money, rep, XP)
- Validates resource spending
- Verifies boundary enforcement (no negatives)

#### Test 7: Upgrade System (Tycoon) ✅
- Tests upgrade lookup by name
- Validates purchase mechanics
- Verifies cost deduction

## 🔧 Technical Challenges Solved

### Challenge 1: LÖVE Filesystem Dependency
**Problem**: DataManager requires `love.filesystem` to load JSON data  
**Solution**: Created comprehensive filesystem mock using standard Lua I/O and shell commands

### Challenge 2: Contract ID Lookup
**Problem**: Test assumed contracts stored as array, but they're stored as dictionary  
**Solution**: Used `next()` to get first available contract ID

### Challenge 3: Auto-Accept Interference
**Problem**: Contract system auto-accepts contracts, interfering with manual testing  
**Solution**: Disable auto-accept in tests: `contractSystem.autoAcceptEnabled = false`

### Challenge 4: Time-Based Generation
**Problem**: Contracts/threats require time to generate  
**Solution**: Call `update(dt)` with sufficient delta time to trigger generation

### Challenge 5: Missing Return Values
**Problem**: `acceptContract()` doesn't return success/failure  
**Solution**: Verify acceptance by checking active contracts table

### Challenge 6: Threat System Not Initialized
**Problem**: ThreatSystem templates not loaded  
**Solution**: Added missing `threatSystem:initialize()` call

## 📊 Validation Results

### Systems Validated
✅ ResourceManager - Resource flow and bounds  
✅ ContractSystem - Generation, acceptance, completion  
✅ SpecialistSystem - XP, leveling, skills  
✅ ThreatSystem - Generation, assignment, resolution  
✅ IdleSystem - Passive income generation  
✅ UpgradeSystem - Purchase and effects  
✅ IncidentSpecialistSystem - Threat handling  

### Mechanics Validated
✅ **Idle**: Passive resource generation over time  
✅ **Tycoon**: Contract management and persistent upgrades  
✅ **RPG**: Character progression and skill unlocking  
✅ **RTS**: Real-time threat management and resolution

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Testing Patterns
1. **System Initialization Order Matters**: Must initialize dependencies first
2. **Time Simulation**: Large `update(dt)` calls simulate time passage
3. **Disable Auto-Features**: Turn off automation when testing manual actions
4. **Use Direct Method Calls**: More deterministic than event-based triggers

### Mock Design
1. **Load Mocks First**: Initialize before requiring any game code
2. **Use Standard Lua**: Leverage `io.*` and `os.*` for compatibility
3. **Provide Complete APIs**: Mock all used LÖVE functions
4. **Document Limitations**: Be clear about what mocks can/cannot do
