## 🎯 Core Innovation: Universal Item System

### Before (Current State):
```
Contracts → ContractSystem (hardcoded logic)
Specialists → SpecialistSystem (hardcoded logic)
Upgrades → UpgradeSystem (hardcoded logic)
Threats → ThreatSystem (hardcoded logic)
❌ No cross-system interactions
❌ Hard to balance
❌ Code changes for new content
```

### After (AWESOME Architecture):
```
Everything → ItemRegistry → Universal Schema
                ↓
          EffectProcessor → Cross-system synergies
                ↓
          FormulaEngine → Data-driven math
                ↓
          Systems use effects, not hardcoded logic
✅ Items interact naturally
✅ Easy to balance
✅ JSON-only content creation
✅ Emergent gameplay
```

---

## 💡 Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. **Data-Driven Design**
```json
{
  "id": "any_game_item",
  "type": "contract|specialist|upgrade|threat|event",
  "effects": {
    "passive": [...],
    "active": [...]
  },
  "requirements": {...},
  "scaling": {...}
}
```
**Benefit**: Designers create content without touching code

### 2. **Effect-Based Interactions**
```lua
effectiveValue = EffectProcessor:calculateValue(
    baseValue,
    effectType,
    context -- includes ALL active items
)
```
**Benefit**: Cross-system synergies emerge naturally

### 3. **Formula-Driven Scaling**
```json
{
  "scaling": {
    "formula": "base * pow(1.15, level) * efficiency"
  }
}
```
**Benefit**: Balance changes without deployment

### 4. **Event-Driven Communication**
```lua
eventBus:publish("contract_completed", data)
-- Achievement system listens
-- Specialist system awards XP
-- Resource system adds rewards
-- Analytics system tracks
```
**Benefit**: Zero coupling between systems
