# Development Plan â€” Phase 1 (Foundation)

This file outlines the initial Phase 1 plan for the project, focusing on the `feature/core-ui` vertical slice.

Objectives:
- Implement `feature/core-ui` (HUD, top bar, specialist roster skeleton)
- Implement `feature/idle-resources` (resource display and ResourceManager integration)
- Implement `feature/specialists` (specialist roster data and basic UI)

Deliverables:
- UI skeleton in `src/ui/` and `src/core/ui_manager.lua` integration
- Tests for resource calculations under `tests/`
- Issue tracking and PR template usage for features

How to work:
- Follow `.github/copilot-instructions/12-development-roadmap.instructions.md`
- Create a feature branch per task
- Write small, testable units; add tests before implementing when possible
