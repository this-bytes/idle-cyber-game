  "buildings": {
    "building_id": {
      "name": "Building Name",
      "description": "Building description",
      "unlocked": true,

      "name": "Currency Name",
      "symbol": "$",
      "startingAmount": 1000,
      "maxAmount": 999999,

          "influence": 5
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Event-Driven Architecture

The system uses an EventBus for decoupled communication:

### Key Events

- `location_changed`: Fired when player moves between locations
- `building_unlocked`: When new buildings become available
- `contract_completed`: When work generates resources
- `achievement_unlocked`: When achievements are earned
- `tier_promoted`: When player advances tiers

### Event Flow Example

```
Player moves â†’ LocationSystem publishes location_changed â†’ 
ProgressionSystem updates stats â†’ Achievement checks â†’ 
UI updates bonuses display
```

## Smart & Extensible Design

### 1. Data-Driven Configuration
- All locations defined in JSON (no code changes needed)
- Currency rules configurable via JSON
- Achievement triggers and rewards in data files

### 2. Modular System Architecture
- Each system operates independently
- Communication via events (loose coupling)
- Easy to add new systems without modifying existing ones

### 3. Hierarchical Validation
- Building â†’ Floor â†’ Room validation chain
- Graceful fallbacks for invalid locations
- Comprehensive error handling

### 4. Extensible Bonus System
- Location bonuses stack multiplicatively
- Easy to add new bonus types via JSON
- Real-time bonus calculation and application

### 5. Comprehensive Testing
- 30+ automated tests covering all systems
- Integration tests validate system interactions
- Location validation and state persistence tests

## Performance Considerations

    self.resourceManager = resourceManager
    return self
end

function MySystem:initialize()
    -- System initialization
end

function MySystem:update(dt)
    -- System update logic
end

-- Register with GameLoop
gameLoop:registerSystem("mySystem", mySystem, priority)
```

### Fortress Resource Management
```lua
-- ResourceManager unified interface
resourceManager:addResource("money", 1000)
resourceManager:spendResources({money = 500, reputation = 10})

-- Event-driven updates
eventBus:publish("resource_changed", {
    resource = "money",
    oldValue = 1000,
    newValue = 1500
})
```

### Security Upgrade Integration
```lua
-- Purchase security upgrade
local success = securityUpgrades:purchaseUpgrade("enterprise_firewall")
if success then
    -- Upgrade affects threat simulation automatically
    local threatReduction = securityUpgrades:getThreatReduction("malware")
    print("Malware protection increased by " .. threatReduction .. "%")
